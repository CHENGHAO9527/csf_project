Buildingthe  package to get Forest Fires Dataset ready for machine learning modeling for different frameworks.
Datasets: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires

We use Python to analyze the forest fire data. Specific packages used are Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. We use Matplotlib for visualizations. For the methods the team used to make our predictor, we tried Neural Net, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
